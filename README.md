## Overview

Meal Match is a full-stack web application that makes meal prep smarter and more flexible. Instead of relying on rigid recipes, users prepare components in advance and mix and match them into meals throughout the week.

With built-in AI, Meal Match also provides intelligent meal suggestions based on your preferences, dietary restrictions, and what is already in your kitchen.
